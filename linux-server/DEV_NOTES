Notes on my code modification. 
 (frlind, July 2?.) 


 - I have broken up this monstrous main.c into some 
   zillions of files. Maybe I've gone a bit tooooo far
   by splitting up the capi functions. 

 - I hope to implement ip-address-based auth very soon. 
   This is while I have some hash functions in config/. 

 - I will create some format of user/password thing in 
   the config file. this is what auth/ is intended to be. 
   Let's talk about a format for clear-text password 
   submission as a first step. 
   I propose some king of struct: 

   struct auth_upa {
   	int username_len; 
	int passwd_len;
	char data[];
   }

   Ok?
   Could you do this for meeee? Pleeease?

 - Have fun. How far has development of the linux-client reached?
