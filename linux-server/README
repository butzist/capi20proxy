CAPI 2.0 Proxy Project, 
  capifwd Server for Linux. 


1. What is capifwd/CAPI 2.0 Proxy?
 CAPI 2.0 Proxy is a set of programs for forwarding CAPI ISDN commands
 over a TCP/IP capable network. This can be used to share ISDN devices 
 over a network to provide e.g. fax, internet or voice services.

1.1. Status of the Project
 The project was founded in early 2002 by Adam Szalkowski and as of 
 August 2002 development versions of the MS Windows Client and Server 
 as well as of the Linux Server are available. 
 Development on the Linux Client module has been very active over the
 past weeks and a first development snapshot will be ready soon. 

2. Installing the Linux Server. 
 First, be sure to have the latest version of CapiFwd either from 
 sf.net/projects/capi20proxy or directly from CVS. You also might 
 want to check out http://frlind.no-ip.org/code, I post pre-release 
 versions there. 
 Also make sure to have libcapi installed, as this library is needed
 by the server. I hope to be able to use kernelcapi instead in a 
 future version but until then go visit www.capi4linux.org to get 
 capi4kutils or libcapi20.
 
 Then, simply type 'cd src && make all install' at the command promt, 
 a configure script is currently not needed.
 
3. Misc.
