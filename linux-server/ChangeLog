ChangeLog for the Linux-Server of CAPI20Proxy 
 by F. Lindenberg, A. Szalkowski, (C) 2002. 

Changes from 0.6.2 to 0.6.3:
 - The program has been split up into many source files. 
 - An init-script has been added. The script was made for 
   Debian 3.0 but it should work with any other distro, too.
 - PThread code was removed completely. 
 - Command-Line arguments were added. I also tried out some 
   code on config-files but it proofed to be not stable 
   enough to go into mainstream capifwd. 
 - A problem with zombies beeing created by handlers was 
   removed by adding a SIGCHLD handler. 
 - New "chackdep.sh"-script that checks for libcapi. 
 - The Code was cleaned up everywhere. 

Changes previous to 0.6.2: 
 - There is no ChangeLog for the whole program previous to 0.6.2. 
   There are, however, the entries from CVS Log in main.c:
